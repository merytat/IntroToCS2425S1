After interrogating the suspects, you have learned the following information:
- Dexter said the family gathered up to celebrate Samuel's 78th birthday, and Samuel shared a private announcement
- Pippa insisted that no one would purposefully kill Ernest, and shared her theory that whoever killed him intended to kill Samuel instead
- Naomi reported that she observed Dexter and Ernest arguing the night before his murder (Pippa backed up this information, admitting that her brother and father never really got along)
- Sebastian disclosed that the possible motive for the murder was Samuel announcing that he adjusted his will, changing the heir of his wealth from Audrey to Ernest (When mentioned to Audrey, she froze up but claimed that she would never hurt her baby boy, no matter what)
- Samuel shared his concerns that Sebastian had a grudge against Ernest (Sebastian claimed that Ernest was like a son to him)
- Audrey offered that Dexter possibly killed his father in a rage, due to the recent divorce between Ernest and Erin (Dexter's mother)

However, while you were interrogating the suspects, the police decided to take Ernest's dead body back to the station. Despite your pleading, the police refused to share their notes on the investigation, claiming that if the body mattered so much you should've just done that first.
